These files are part of Dylan Pereira’s coursework from an online course in Scrimba, an online learning platform. The project is a mock ecommerce site which displays a list of pictures in a gallery. The pictures can then be added to a shopping cart and theoretically ordered to be shipped. 

The project involved: 

• React Router
• Hooks and Custom Hooks
• React Context API (which is an alternative to Redux)
• React prop types.
