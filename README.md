These files are part of Dylan Pereira’s coursework from an online course in Scrimba, an online learning platform. The project is a mock ecommerce site which displays a list of pictures in a gallery. The pictures can then be added to a shopping cart and theoretically ordered to be shipped. <br/>

The project involved: <br/>

- React Router <br/>
- Hooks and Custom Hooks <br/>
- React Context API (which is an alternative to Redux) <br/>
- React prop types. <br/>
